**Step 0: When to Use Sliding Window**

    Use sliding window IF:

    Problem asks for subarray / substring

    Array/string is contiguous

    Condition is based on sum / count / frequency

    Elements are non-negative (or monotonic condition)


**Concept of Sliding Window:**                                                                        
                            
The sliding window approach involves two pointers, usually referred to as left and right, which represent the boundaries of the current window. The window "slides" over the array, either expanding by moving the right pointer or contracting by moving the left pointer, to maintain a subset of elements that satisfies certain conditions.
